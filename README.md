# Whats-App-Bot
So basically it's a 2 line python program which can automatically send my selected message to the selected 
person at the selected time . We just need to install the pywhatkit library and to import it in the code , that's it !

 # Library Rquired
 Whatskit Library , which we can easily install by writing the below code in the command prompt or the terminal
 
       pip install whatskit
       
 # Storing The data of the sent messages
   So , All the messages which will be sent through this program will be strored in a text file which will be
   created automatically by running the code . You can check all the data just like the 'Phone Number','The Message' ,'Time'  & 'Date' 
   in that file just by clicking on that one .
